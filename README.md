# Mortgage App

This repository contains the code for the `Mortgage App` project developed by `Team X`. The app is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for individuals seeking to understand, apply for, and manage a mortgage. 

## Features

1. **Mortgage Calculator**: This feature allows users to calculate the amount of mortgage they can afford, including the monthly payment, interest rate, and total cost of the loan. It provides a detailed overview of principal and interest amounts, and offers weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly detailed views of calculations. It also includes additional parameters for rental and other income calculations.

2. **Loan Comparison**: This feature helps users compare different mortgage loans offered by various lenders. It includes the total calculation for the amortization period (principal/interest) and monthly calculation (principal/interest).

3. **PDF Upload**: This feature allows users to upload and store important documents related to their mortgage application, such as tax returns, bank statements, and pay stubs.

4. **Loan Status Tracker**: This feature enables users to track the progress of their mortgage application, including when their application has been received, approved, or denied.

5. **Referral Programs**: This feature incentivizes users to refer friends and family to the app, potentially earning rewards or discounts on their own mortgage.

Please refer to the individual directories for each feature for more detailed information. Contributions are welcome, please feel free to submit a pull request.
